# [Home Tasks](https://home.dliu.com)

A small website for recording recurring home tasks. The home page links to separate trackers for laundry, guinea pig cleaning, hanging clothes, and Kaka teeth brushing. Laundry uses a rolling 40-hour target, guinea pig cleaning uses 70 hours, hanging clothes uses 45 hours, and Kaka teeth brushing uses 100 hours.

The current user-facing rules are documented at [`/rules.html`](https://home.dliu.com/rules.html).

## Architecture

The project follows the `home-site` layout:

- `src/` contains the static webpages. The shared `menu.js` web component renders the same navigation menu on every page.
- CloudFront serves the site from a private S3 bucket at `home.dliu.com`.
- `POST /api/timestamps` records the server's current time for the selected task through a Lambda Function URL.
- `GET /api/timestamps` returns the selected task's latest 10 timestamps from DynamoDB.
- `DELETE /api/timestamps` deletes a selected task record during its first hour, after browser confirmation.
- DynamoDB atomically rejects attempts made within one hour of the previous record for the same task.
- The DynamoDB table is retained if the CloudFormation stack is deleted.

## Cost model

The stack avoids provisioned servers, NAT gateways, load balancers, API Gateway, and other resources with meaningful fixed monthly fees. Lambda, DynamoDB on-demand, S3, and CloudFront are charged according to requests, storage, execution time, and data transfer. The ACM certificate is free, and the Route 53 hosted zone is imported from the existing dliu.com infrastructure rather than created by this stack.

## Commands

```sh
make install
make test
make synth
make deploy
```

## GitHub Actions deployment

The deployment workflow is stored in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. It runs the tests and deploys the existing `LaundrySite` CloudFormation stack in `eu-west-1` whenever a commit is pushed to `main`. It can also be started manually from the repository's **Actions** tab.

Configure these two GitHub Actions repository secrets before running the workflow:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

In GitHub, open the `home` repository and go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**. Add each value under its exact name. Use a dedicated AWS deployment identity with only the permissions needed for this CDK stack; never use AWS root-account credentials.

The same secrets can be added with GitHub CLI. Each command securely prompts for the value:

```sh
gh secret set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
gh secret set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

Credentials stored in the local AWS configuration are not automatically available to GitHub-hosted runners. Do not commit credentials, `.env` files, or AWS configuration files to this repository.
